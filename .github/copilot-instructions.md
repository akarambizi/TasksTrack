## Instruction Files Structure

This project has separated instruction files for better readability and focused guidance:

### 📋 **Main Instructions** (this file)
- Project overview and general guidelines
- Development workflow and best practices
- Git workflow and code review guidelines

### 🖥️ **Server Instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions-server.md`)
- References to existing ASP.NET Core 8 patterns in your codebase
- Guides Copilot to follow your established C# conventions and architecture
- Points to actual implementations (AuthController.cs, AuthService.cs, etc.)
- Emphasizes learning through understanding existing patterns
- Focuses on consistency with your Repository Pattern and JWT authentication

### 🌐 **Client Instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions-client.md`)
- References to existing React 18 + TypeScript patterns in your codebase
- Guides Copilot to follow your established component and hook patterns
- Points to actual implementations (useAuth.ts, Login.tsx, etc.)
- Emphasizes learning through understanding existing code structure
- Focuses on consistency with your TanStack Query and interface patterns

## General Guidelines

**🎯 IMPORTANT: Always examine and follow the patterns already established in your existing codebase rather than creating new ones.**

- **Reference existing files first** before writing new code
- **Study established patterns** in your Controllers, Services, Components, and Hooks
- **Maintain consistency** with your existing naming conventions and architecture
- **Follow your established error handling** and validation approaches
- **Use the same libraries and patterns** already implemented in your project
- **Focus on learning** - understand the "why" behind existing patterns, not just the "how"

## Key Naming Conventions Summary

### Server (C#/.NET)
```csharp
// Classes: PascalCase
public class ToDoTaskService

// Interfaces: Start with "I"
public interface IToDoTaskService

// Methods: PascalCase
public async Task<bool> UpdateAsync()

// Private fields: camelCase with underscore
private readonly IToDoTaskRepository _repository;
```

### Client (TypeScript/React)
```typescript
// Interfaces: Start with "I" + PascalCase
interface ITaskCardProps {
    task: IToDoTask;
    onUpdate: (task: IToDoTask) => void;
}

// Components: PascalCase
export const TaskCard: React.FC<ITaskCardProps> = ({ task, onUpdate }) => {
    // Component logic
};

// Custom hooks: camelCase starting with "use"
export const useTasks = () => {
    // Hook logic
};
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Git Workflow
- Create feature branches from main
- Use conventional commit messages
- Write meaningful pull request descriptions
- Test thoroughly before merging

### 2. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Includes appropriate error handling
- [ ] Has unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] API endpoints are properly documented
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Performance implications are considered

### 3. Debugging Tips
- Use Visual Studio/VS Code debugger effectively
- Set breakpoints in both client and server code
- Use browser dev tools for frontend debugging
- Monitor network requests in browser
- Check server logs for API issues

## Key Commands and Tools

### .NET CLI Commands
```bash
# Project management
dotnet new webapi -n MyProject
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
dotnet test

# Entity Framework migrations
dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
dotnet ef database update
dotnet watch run

# Package management
dotnet add package PackageName
dotnet remove package PackageName
dotnet list package
```

### Node.js/NPM Commands
```bash
# Client development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run dev:mock     # Start with mock server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Full stack development
docker-compose up --build    # Start all services
docker-compose down          # Stop all services
make up                      # Alternative using Makefile

```

## Learning Resources

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the specific instruction files:

- **📖 Server Development**: See `.github/copilot-instructions-server.md` for C#/.NET pattern references
- **🎨 Client Development**: See `.github/copilot-instructions-client.md` for React/TypeScript pattern references

## Key Learning Philosophy

**This is a learning project designed to help you master full-stack development through hands-on experience.**

### 🎯 **Learning Approach**
- **Study existing code first** - Your codebase contains real, working implementations
- **Understand patterns before extending** - Learn why certain approaches were chosen
- **Build incrementally** - Each new feature should build upon established foundations
- **Ask questions** - Always seek to understand the reasoning behind patterns and practices

### 🚀 **Growth Areas**
- **Backend**: C# language features, .NET ecosystem, Entity Framework, API design, security
- **Frontend**: React patterns, TypeScript advanced features, state management, performance optimization
- **Full-Stack**: Integration patterns, testing strategies, deployment, architecture decisions

Remember: Both frontend and backend development have endless learning opportunities. The patterns in your codebase are your foundation - understanding them deeply will make you a better developer as you continue to grow and evolve your skills.
