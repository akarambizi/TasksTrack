3. **Study [dependency-injection.md](./dependency-injection.md)** to understand how components connect
4. **Explore [repository-pattern.md](./repository-pattern.md)** to understand data access patterns

### For API Development

1. **Review [api-development.md](./api-development.md)** for endpoint design patterns
2. **Check [authentication.md](./authentication.md)** for security implementation
3. **Reference existing controllers** for practical examples
4. **Write tests** following [unit-tests.md](./unit-tests.md) guidance

### For Database Work

1. **Follow [db-setup.md](./db-setup.md)** for Entity Framework operations
2. **Check [migrations/troubleshooting-guide.md](./migrations/troubleshooting-guide.md)** for migration issues
3. **Review [migrations/case-studies/](./migrations/case-studies/)** for real-world problem solutions

## Key Learning Philosophy

This documentation is designed around the principle of **learning through understanding existing patterns**:

- **Study before creating** - Examine existing implementations before writing new code
- **Understand the "why"** - Each document explains reasoning behind architectural decisions
- **Practice consistently** - Follow established patterns to build muscle memory
- **Document insights** - Add to [learning-notes.md](./learning-notes.md) as insights are discovered
