# TODOs

- [ ] **Database Design**: Understand and implement database schema design, normalization, relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), and indexing.
- [ ] **API Design**: Learn and apply the principles of RESTful API design. Understand the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- [ ] **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement user authentication using techniques such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth. Apply role-based access control for authorizing user actions.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Implement a robust error handling mechanism. Handle both expected and unexpected errors, and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**: Incorporate logging into the application for debugging and understanding application behavior. Explore application performance monitoring tools.
- [ ] **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.
- [ ] **Caching**: Implement caching to improve performance. Consider both in-memory caching and using a distributed cache like Redis.
- [ ] **Asynchronous Processing**: If the application has long-running tasks, make them asynchronous. This could involve using background jobs, queues, and workers.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent potential abuse.
- [ ] **Microservices**: If the application is large, consider breaking it down into microservices. Each microservice should be loosely coupled and independently deployable.
